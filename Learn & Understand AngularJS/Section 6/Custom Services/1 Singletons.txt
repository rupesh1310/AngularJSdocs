		But a singleton doesn't give you copies
		it gives only one.

		AngularJS services are implemented as singletons.

		$log service is a singleton

		$scope is an exception in angularjs

		$scope in angularjs is a childscope

		Passing it to a new controller will let it create a new $scope

		Creating your own service will also be a singleton.
