Creating a service:
===================


	For custom service, angularjs doesn't run digest loop


	A service holds a reference to any object.

	A factory is a function which returns any object

	A provider is a function which returns any function

	Service is a constructor function that will be called  with new.

	factory is a function that returns an object you can run some code before.

	


	app.service('myService', function() {

  // service is just a constructor function
  // that will be called with 'new'

  this.sayHello = function(name) {
     return "Hi " + name + "!";
  };
});

	app.factory('myFactory', function() {

	  // factory returns an object
	  // you can run some code before

	  return {
	    sayHello : function(name) {
	      return "Hi " + name + "!";
	    }
	  }
	});
