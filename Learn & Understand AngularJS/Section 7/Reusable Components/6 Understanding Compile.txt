Understanding Compile:
======================

Compile and Link:
-----------------

	When building the code , the compiler converts code to a lower level language that the computer understands.

	Then the linker generates a file the computer will actually interact with.

	Linker combines all those files and builds a single file that is executable that computer interacts with.



AngularJS compile and link:
===========================

	Compiling runs only once.

	Linking runs more than once.

	Each loop has its own scope.


	So when we have nested custom directives, angular js compiles once and run pre-link.

	Looks any nested custom directives and run pre-link for them.

	After reaching the bottom of the chain, it runs post-link back up the chain.

	Post-link is safer than pre-link.

	AVOID USING PRE LINK.

	Mostly we don't use compile stage.. very rare.
