Isolated Scope:
===============

Isolate the controller from the scope of the directive.

scope:{} gives its own directive scope.

@ => to get only text/string value of attributes

=   => tells us this is a 2 way binding that we can pass an object via this property of the scope.

assign the whole object to that attribute to get the individual obj properties.

Caution with =:
================

	we can get in trouble if we do two way data binding.

	Find yourself in unusual circumstances.


Functions on directives:
========================

& means function 

function takes an object as an argument.

pass an mapping object inside the function as param and map it to the object.
