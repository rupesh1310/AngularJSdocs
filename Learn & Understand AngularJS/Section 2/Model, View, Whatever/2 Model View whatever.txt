Model, View and whatever...
==========================

	Connect HTML and data

	MVC:
	====

		Model : in JS let's say, a  variable
		View : what the user sees, the HTML
		binds the model and the view

		Model and View are bound together
		Any changes made to the view affects the model and vice versa.

		Binding is done by controllers, view models and whatever.

		AngularJS is MV*
