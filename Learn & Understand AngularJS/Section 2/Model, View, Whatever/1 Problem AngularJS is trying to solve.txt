Problem AngularJS is trying to solve:
====================================

	 If we have 2 UI buttons it is ok to use jQuery.

	 But what if we have 20?!?!

	 Representation of the HTML that sits inside browser's memory.

	 Way for us to Manipulate and read code.

	 More code if we use jQuery.

	 Just update one side and other side updated automatically.

	 Update JS and HTML auto updates.

	 Complexity of managing both the DOM and HTML and logic and variables and data manually.
